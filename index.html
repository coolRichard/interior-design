			<p>	Piedmont, or mountain, glaciers are found in many parts of the world. In North America they are distributed along the mountain ranges of the Pacific Coast from central California northward. They abound in the Andes range in South America and are familiar and greatly admired spectacles in the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Caucasus Mountains and the mountains of Scandanavia. Rivers of ice flow down the valleys of various Asian mountain ranges, including the Himalayas, the Hindu Kush, and the Karakoram and Kunlun ranges. They are also a feature of the Southern Alps of New Zealand and are found in the lofty mountains of New Guinea. The largest piedmont glaciers are the Malaspina and Bering glaciers, both in Alaska.</p>

			<p>Best team in the world. <br><br>
			My favorite childhood toys reflect the places I lived in when I was young. My favorite toy as a child of seven years old was the dried fallen branches in the woods. There was a small one behind our house and it provided endless fun for me and my brothers and sisters. Collected sticks and branches became our castle, our fort, and our play home. Wood pieces gave us play swords, fishing rods, umbrellas, and jungle gyms. They were my best childhood toy because they contained so many other toys. What I most loved to play with at eight years old was dirt marbles. We lived in a neighborhood where there was an eternal pit of mud on the strip of grass in front of our apartment. My brothers and I would mix the smooth mud with sand from the side of the road, roll it into balls and leave them to dry in the hot afternoon sun. We would hit them against each other to gain points and arm our slingshots with them. </p> <br>
